title: "Federated Learning Frameworks for Medical Image Analysis"
venue-pretext : 'Medical imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, generating large amounts of complex and heterogeneous data. Training machine learning models on medical imaging data faces challenges such as data complexity, scarcity, and privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed machine learning, allowing models to be trained on data distributed across multiple devices or data centers without compromising privacy. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of FL frameworks for the medical image domain. We compare the performance of four frameworks (FedML, FLARE, Flower, and OpenFL) using a dataset of chest X-ray images and the MobileNetV2 CNN architecture. Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC-ROC. The results indicate variations in the frameworks' classification accuracy, with FedML demonstrating superior performance, followed by FLARE and Flower. OpenFL exhibited lower performance. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate FL framework for accurate medical image classification. The study contributes insights for researchers and practitioners, aiding in framework selection and improving medical image analysis. Further research can explore additional metrics, architectures, and datasets, advancing FL in the medical domain for enhanced healthcare diagnostics'
