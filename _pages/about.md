Hello! I’m Kenan Kocadurdu, a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and its applications in healthcare.

I have several years of experience developing AI-based systems to support medical decision-making and improve operational efficiency. My work combines deep learning, computer vision, and bioinformatics to solve real-world problems in both clinical and industrial environments. I love exploring how technology can bring innovation to healthcare and make a real difference in people’s lives.

On this website, you’ll find my resume, portfolio, and open-source codes. Feel free to connect if you’re interested in collaboration, research opportunities, or just want to chat about AI in medicine.

Let’s build something meaningful together!
