## üî¨ Project Overview

**Auto-Micro** is a modular AI platform for automatic **microscopy image analysis**. It processes raw microscope or whole-slide images (WSI) and delivers fast, explainable predictions through a microservice architecture.

The system is designed to:

- Handle **high-resolution medical images** (e.g., histopathology, microbiology)
- Support **on-premise deployment** with no cloud dependency
- Provide **end-to-end automation**: from image ingestion to model inference
- Enable real-time interaction through a **React frontend and REST APIs**

Auto-Micro combines **deep learning**, **MLOps**, and **Kubernetes orchestration** to streamline digital pathology workflows.

## üß´ Clinical Background

Microscopy-based diagnostics are critical in detecting infections, cancer, and tissue abnormalities. However, manual examination of slides is:

- Time-consuming  
- Prone to human error  
- Inconsistent between experts  

Auto-Micro supports clinicians and researchers by offering a **scalable**, **reproducible**, and **interpretable** AI pipeline for analyzing complex image data.

## üéØ Research Objective

Auto-Micro is designed to:

- Automate the **preprocessing and patch extraction** from large WSI files  
- Train and serve **deep learning models** for classification and segmentation tasks  
- Provide an **interactive dashboard** to monitor data and models  
- Ensure **traceability and reproducibility** for clinical research  
- Run completely on **local infrastructure** with Kubernetes (Minikube)

## üß† Core Features

- **Microservices Architecture**  
  Independent FastAPI services for data handling, training, and inference

- **On-Prem MLOps**  
  Continuous integration, training, and model deployment inside local clusters

- **Explainable AI**  
  Grad-CAM visualizations and patch-level prediction summaries

- **Modular Storage with MinIO**  
  Efficient handling of WSIs, patch sets, annotations, and model artifacts

- **Interactive Frontend**  
  Built with React for uploading, monitoring, and viewing model results

## üß™ Methodology

The pipeline consists of four main stages:

### 1. Data Acquisition & Processing
- Real-time upload from microscopes or bulk import of WSIs  
- Patch extraction with configurable tile sizes   

### 2. Model Training
- Models built in **PyTorch** with support for CNNs and Vision Transformers   

### 3. Inference & Deployment
- Best-performing model selected based on validation metrics  
- Deployed as an API endpoint within Kubernetes using FastAPI  
- Responses returned in real time with heatmaps and class scores

### 4. Visualization & Monitoring
- Web-based dashboard with React  
- Shows patch predictions, Grad-CAM overlays
